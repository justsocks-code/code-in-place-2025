# Code in Place 2025 – Week 4: Python Control Flow

Welcome to Week 4 of my Code in Place 2025 journey!  
This week focused on using control flow in Python: conditional statements (`if`, `else`), loops (`for`, `while`), and interactive logic.

### Challenge 1 – Double It

📝 Description:  
Prompts the user for a number and keeps doubling it until the result is at least 100, printing each intermediate value.

📁 : `double_it.py`

### Challenge 2 – Hailstone

📝 Description:  
Implements the Hailstone (Collatz) sequence. Repeats: if the number is even, divide by 2; if odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Stops at 1 and counts steps.

### Challenge 3 – Joke Bot

📝 Description:  
Simple interactive bot: if the user types `"Joke"`, it tells a programmer joke; otherwise, it apologizes.

### Challenge 4 – Khansole Academy

📝 Description:  
Simulates a math quiz: randomly generates two-digit addition problems and checks if the user's answer is correct.

📁 : `khansole_academy.py`

### Challenge 5 – Liftoff

📝 Description:  
Counts down from 10 to 1 using a `for` loop, then prints `"Liftoff!"`.

📁 : `liftoff.py`

### Challenge 6 – Random Numbers

📝 Description:  
Generates and prints 10 random numbers between 1 and 100 using constants and a `for` loop.

📁 : `random_numbers.py`

### Challenge 7 – The Game of Nimm

📝 Description:  
Two players take turns removing 1 or 2 stones from a pile. The player forced to take the last stone **loses**. Includes input validation and formatted prompts.
